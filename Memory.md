# Memory — InsightScope: Global Intelligence Dashboard

## Project status

- Project: InsightScope — Global Intelligence Dashboard (`blackcoffer-visualization-dashboard`)
- **Phase 2 — FastAPI Filtering/Analytics API: COMPLETE** (implemented and verified 2026-09-08).
- Phase 0: **APPROVED**. Phase 1: **COMPLETE**. Phase 2: **COMPLETE**.
- Phase 3 (Frontend Design System and Dashboard Shell) awaits explicit user approval.

## Source dataset

- Path: `data/raw/jsondata.json` (immutable, git-tracked)
- SHA-256: `f45b67f7d4a252c5daa3ec0dfd9c7ceb4e415106c404646f66bff93d9aeb1744` (re-verified at Phase 1 start)
- Profile: 1,000 records; 17 fields; 97 topics; 18 sectors; 23 regions; 56 countries; 9 PESTLE;
  403 sources; no duplicates; 670 unique URLs.
- Anomalies preserved by policy: blank-string-as-missing; extreme `end_year` (2126, 2200);
  case-distinct `World`(131)/`world`(1); trailing whitespace in 16 `source` values (trimmed);
  non-standard dates (`"January, 20 2017 03:51:25"`, kept verbatim).
- City: NOT present in dataset. SWOT: NOT present in dataset. Neither is manufactured.

## Change control log

- 2026-09-08 (Phase 1, user directive): Record identity = `sha256("<dataset_sha256>:<source_row_index>")`;
  `source_row_index` + `source_dataset_sha256` stored per document. Updated PRD FR-4,
  Architecture §1 diagram + §3.1 + ADR 2, Phases.md Phase 1.
- 2026-09-08 (Phase 1): CORS middleware included in the Phase 1 foundation (config
  `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` already defined) so the web app can call the API during development.
- 2026-09-08 (Phase 1, discovered during implementation):
  - PyMongo 4.18: `pymongo.asynchronous.AsyncMongoClient` is a documented alias but is **not
    exported at package top level**; correct import is
    `from pymongo.asynchronous.mongo_client import AsyncMongoClient`. Architecture §10 updated.
  - pydantic-settings JSON-decodes `list` env fields before validators; `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` uses
    `Annotated[list[str], NoDecode]` + a before-validator that splits on commas. (Code change
    only; Architecture §11 unchanged — env var names/behavior identical.)
  - Next.js 16 auto-generates `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` during dev; disabled via
    `agentRules: false` in `next.config.ts`, files deleted (repo hygiene).
  - ESLint `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` (new in eslint-config-next 16): data-fetch
    effects must set state only in async callbacks; implemented with a pure async fetcher +
    `.then()` + cancellation flag in the dev status page.
- 2026-09-08 (Phase 2):
  - PyMongo 4.18 runtime bug: `collection.aggregate()` returns a **coroutine** (must `await`),
    while `collection.find()` returns an **AsyncCursor** directly (no await). Caught by pyright;
    fixed in `app/services.py`.
  - Pydantic `BaseModel` has a `.schema()` method; a field named `schema` would conflict.
    Renamed to `dataset_schema` with `Field(serialization_alias="schema")` in `MetaResponse`.
  - `FilterSpec` uses repeated query params (`?topic=oil&topic=gas`) not comma-separated;
    ranges use snake_case (`intensity_min`/`intensity_max`). Default `page_size` is 25 not 20.
  - `SEARCH_FIELDS` covers 7 fields (not just `title`/`insight`); sort whitelist is
    `source_row_index, end_year, start_year, intensity, likelihood, relevance, topic, sector, country`.
  - `city`/`swot` dimensions always 422 `unavailable_dimension`.
  - Added `app/errors.py`, `app/aggregations.py` (COVERAGE_FIELDS, SOURCES_OVERVIEW_LIMIT=20, METRIC_BINS),
    `app/filters.py` (CATEGORICAL_PARAMS, YEAR_PARAMS, RANGE_PARAMS, FACET_DIMENSIONS, SEARCH_FIELDS,
    SORTABLE_FIELDS, RECORD_ID_PATTERN, UNAVAILABLE_DIMENSIONS), `app/schemas.py` (all typed response models),
    `app/routers/{meta,facets,overview,records}.py`.
  - Added `pyright` to dev dependencies; pyright 0 errors achieved.
  - Environment note (not a project change): the user's unrelated docker stack
    (`olist-analytics-blueprint`) occupies host ports 3000 and 5433. Our compose project is
    `insightscope` (mongo 27017 free). If 3000 is busy, Next picks 3001 and that origin must be
    added to `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (documented in README troubleshooting).

## Testing status (final Phase 2 run, 2026-09-08)

- Backend unit: **61 passed** (normalize, config, health/ready, filters/build_match, pagination
  validation, record-id validation).
- Backend integration (with `MONGODB_TEST_URI` + Mongo up): **30 passed** (overview, facets,
  records, meta, error shapes). 8 integration tests skipped when Mongo is unavailable.
- Backend without Mongo env: 61 passed, 8 skipped gracefully. Ruff format + check clean.
- Pyright: **0 errors** across `app/` and `tests/`.
- Frontend: `pnpm lint` clean, `pnpm typecheck` clean, `pnpm build` clean (static route).
- DB: clean-volume seed → 1,000 docs; second seed → 1,000 docs / 0 removed; container restart
  → data persists; `/ready` → `{"status":"ready","database":"connected","dataset":"seeded","document_count":1000}`.
- Live smoke (when Docker available): uvicorn health 200, ready 200; representative API queries
  (`/overview?topic=oil`, `/facets?topic=oil&country=...`, `/records?q=energy`, `/records/{id}`)
  return verified correct aggregates; malformed id → 422; unknown id → 404; unavailable dimension
  → 422; invalid range → 422.

## Known failures / issues

- Docker daemon stops between sessions; integration tests skip without `MONGODB_TEST_URI`.
  Re-start Docker (`docker compose up -d mongo`) and re-run `MONGODB_TEST_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017 uv run pytest` to verify integration tests.

## Next allowed task

- Await explicit user approval of Phase 2 → then Phase 3 (Frontend Design System and Dashboard Shell).

## Last verified commit

- Phase 2 API implementation commit. See `git log` for SHA.
